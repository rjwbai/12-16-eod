commit is integrated into the processor. It was getting the right number of commits at one point, and then i decided to try to get it to actually print out the values and thats when everything went to shit, its not giving the right results. need to debug. So i commented out the attempts i made to the modules to see if the processor was getting the right values, and restored it back to the original, where i was just testing for if the processor was actually handling the instructions and passing them through all the stages, which it is. its just that the register values are wrong. The testbench focuses only on ALU, so we also need to test it with load and stuff, but it should be fine. biggest issue is that it doesnt output the right results yet. gonna need help with that one.
